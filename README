How to set the encoding for a language that needs different characters than those in ASCII?

Make sure that you include the charset that your language file is encoded in the HTTP header Content-Type, which is likely to be Unicode. Read more about charsets in HTTP at W3C:  http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-charset


Is there a way to know which branch one is currently in? (answer courtesy of Remy)

For the bash shell you can put the following in ~/.bashrc :

	# Function to print the git branch if we are in a git repository
	gitprompt ()
	{
	   if [ -d .git ]; then
	       branch=`git branch | grep "*" | sed 's/\* //'`
	       echo "[$branch]"
	   fi  
	}

	# add \w in front to display current directory
	export PS1="\$(gitprompt)$ "
	
Make sure that you reference the .bashrc in your ~/.bash_profile like so:

	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
